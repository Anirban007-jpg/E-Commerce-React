                                    Steps to IMPLEMENT AUTHORIZATION AND AUTHENTICATION

FIRST STEP

----------
----------

A request is sent to profile update
    That is what url will look like
        http://localhost:8080/profile/userid9354

when there is userid in the upcomming request(url)
    based on that userid
        our backend will make a query to the dtatabase and load the user information (name, email, etc)
            then we will add that information to the request object
            like so: req.profile = userInformation

SECOND STEP

-----------
-----------

add a property called auth in requireSignin()
    so that we know that the user is authenticated
